  writes the picture in the current graphics window to the jpeg file

<div class="docblock"><a name="jpeg_read"></a><h3>jpeg_read</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT image = jpeg_read(filename)
      or image = jpeg_read(filename, comments)
      or shape = jpeg_read(filename, comments, [0,0,0,0])
      or image = jpeg_read(filename, comments, subset)

Read jpeg file FILENAME.  The returned IMAGE is 3-by-width-by-height
for rgb images (the usual case) or just width-by-height for grayscale
images.  Note that the scanline order is top-to-bottom.
If COMMENTS is present, it must be a simple variable reference.
That variable will be set to either nil or a string array containing
all the descriptive comments in the file.

In the third form, the return value is [nchan,width,height] instead
of the image, where nchan=1 or nchan=3.
In the fourth form, SUBSET is [i0,i1,j0,j1] and the returned image is
the subset full_image(..,i0:i1,j0:j1) of the full image.  (This is
inefficient, but, for example, some Mars Rover pictures released by
NASA are inconveniently large.)

<div class="docblock"><a name="jpeg_write"></a><h3>jpeg_write</h3>
  <pre>DOCUMENT jpeg_write, filename, image
      or jpeg_write, filename, image, comments, quality

Write jpeg file FILENAME containing IMAGE at the specified QUALITY.
The default QUALITY is 75; the range is from 0 to 100.  The IMAGE
can be either 3-by-width-by-height for rgb or width-by-height for
grayscale.  Note that scanline order is top-to-bottom.
If COMMENTS is non-nil, it is a string or an array of strings that
will be written as descriptive comments in the jpeg file.
