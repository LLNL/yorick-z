 * Create an mpeg-1 movie file FILENAME.  Write frames with mpeg_write,
 * close with mpeg_close.  The return value is an mpeg encoder object.
 *
 * If given, PARAMS is [bit_rate, frame_rate, gop_size, max_b_frames]
 *    which default to [ 400000,      25,       10,         1       ]
 * The rates are per second, the gop_size is the number of frames
 * before an I-frame is emitted, and max_b_frames is the largest
 * number of consecutive B-frames.  (The third kind of frame is the
 * P-frame; generally, the encoder emits B-frames until it is forced
 * to emit a P-frame by max_b_frames, or an I-frame by gop_size.  The
 * smaller these numbers, the higher quality the movie, but the lower
 * the compression.)  Any of the four PARAMS values may be zero to
 * get the default value, except for max_b_frames, which should be <0
 * to get the default value.
