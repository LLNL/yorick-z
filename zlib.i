 * In any of the first three forms, initiate a zlib deflation
 * BUFFER.  The second two forms allow you to specify a compression
 * LEVEL (0-9 in increasing compression and decreasing speed), and/or
 * a special compression DICTIONARY (which you will need to supply
 * again in order to decompress the data later).
 *
 * After the BUFFER has been created, use z_deflate to compress DATA,
 * adding it to the compressed stream in the BUFFER.  After one or
 * several calls to z_deflate, you can call z_flush in the first form
 * to extract the current BUFFER contents as ZDATA, the portion of
 * the compressed data stream stored in BUFFER.  You can alternate
 * calls to z_deflate and z_flush as many times as you like in order
 * to compress an arbitrary amount of DATA into ZDATA without filling
 * memory.  The NAVAIL returned by z_deflate is a lower limit on the
 * number of bytes of compressed data a subsequent z_flush will return.
 *
 * The final block of DATA must be compressed by a call to z_flush,
 * in the final form.  This flushes all remaining data into the
 * resulting ZDATA and closes the BUFFER.  You can call z_flush
 * in this form immediately after creating the buffer, so that
 * the tersest way to compress a single block of data is:
 *        zdata = z_flush(z_deflate(), data)
 * Use - for DATA to indicate you have no more DATA, but want to
 * finish the compression.

 *       or data = z_flush(buffer)
 *       or data = z_flush(buffer, type)
 *
 * In the first form, initiate a zlib inflation BUFFER.  You use
 * that BUFFER in subsequent calls to z_inflate if you do not know
 * in advance how large the uncompressed DATA will be, or if you
 * want to do the decompression in chunks to conserve memory.
 *
 * Use the second or third forms to actually decompress ZDATA.
 * After one or more calls to z_inflate, you can call z_flush in
 * order to extract whatever uncompressed DATA has so far been
 * produced.  You can optionally specify a TYPE array for
 * z_flush, otherwise the DATA will be a 1D array of char.
 *
 * Alternatively, you can supply a DATA array as the third parameter
 * to z_inflate, in which case z_inflate will uncompress to your DATA
 * array instead of to an internal array in BUFFER.  You can use this
 * form if you already know the size and data type the data will
 * decompress to.  If the returned flag is 3, you can call z_setdict
 * and repeat the call.  Otherwise, a return value other than 0
 * probably represents an error.  Note that z_flush will not return
 * bytes that have been written to a DATA array supplied to z_inflate.
 *
 * The FLAG returned by z_inflate is
 *   0  if the ZDATA stream is complete, in which case no
 *      further calls to z_inflate are legal with that BUFFER
 *      - the next call to z_flush will return all remaining
 *        bytes of the uncompressed data
 *   1  if the ZDATA stream is incomplete, but no additional
 *      uncompressed data is yet available in BUFFER
 *   2  if the ZDATA stream is incomplete, and uncompressed data
 *      can be retrieved from BUFFER by calling z_flush
 *   3  if a DICTIONARY is required to continue decompression
 *      - use z_setdict to set a dictionary and call z_inflate
 *        a second time with the same DATA
 *  -1  if the ZDATA stream completed, but contained additional
 *      bytes after the end
 *  -2  if the ZDATA stream is corrupted
